Viewing Active Users
=====================

LIS allows laboratory administrators to view a list of all active system users through the **Users > Active Users** section in the Admin Portal.

The grid on the **Users** page displays the username, status, email, role and the last login time.

The controls on the **Users** page enable searching for the required profile or instantly creating a new user. In additon, an administrator can export the latest data on users whose role is different from ``Patient``. In terms of the system, such users are referred to as ``non-patients`` For more details, see :doc:`api`.

The filtering options on the **Users** page allow a laboratory administrator to quickly narrow down the displayed results to match the selected criteria. For more details, see :doc:`usage`.

A laboratory administrator with ``Super Admin`` privileges can also manage active users as described in :doc:`manage`.

.. note::

   User management options may differ according to the particular role
