Click the user name when you see it in the list. The user profile appears in the expandable pane.

You bet! You’ve seen how to create an annotation area, but this is just the surface. **GroupDocs PDF Annotator** provides a lot of powerful features for making the workflow easy and efficient, such as leaving comments, drawing figures, calculating distances, highlighting and marking up documents, and much more.
