The panel features the following filtering options:

Option                Description
====================  =============================================================
**Email**             Check the appropriate option to display the users whose 
                      email address is in the ``flowhealth`` domain 
                      (``FH Employees``)
                      or in any other domain (``Non FH Employees``). 
**Practice**          Select a practice name to display only the users associated
                      with this practice.

                      with this laboratory.

**Last Login**        Check an option to display only the users whose most recent
                      login occurred within the specific period. To define
                      the required period more precisely, click **Custom
                      Date Range**.

                      with a specific status.

                      the ``Dev`` role (``Developers``) or with any other role
                      (``Non-Developers``).
